# Tasks for Week #6 

Given the logistic regression model: 

ln(p/1-p) = -3 + 0.8 x Hours_Studied + 1.5 x Review_session

Task 1: Build a logistic regression model (logistic_regression.ipynb)
Using the dataset “student_data.csv,” write code to 
- create a visualization of the data
- fit a model using logistic regression
- output model coefficients and performance metrics such as accuracy and AUC and ROC

Task 2:  Understanding and Prevent Overfitting in the context of SVM (SVM.ipynb)
- Write code to fit a Support Vector Machine model using
    - linear kernel
    - RBF kernel.

For the RBF kernel, use grid search to find the best gamma parameter using k-fold cross-validation.
